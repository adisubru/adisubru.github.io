 - eagerly awaiting the start of my PhD program at IISc.
 - (as I wait) TAing for a java course, while not having any experience with java myself.
 - alternating between binging anime and binging theory course lectures.
 - practicing Color Neutral solves again. Am also hitting just-barely-sub-20 Ao100s on white.

# What am I Learning
 - Kanji. Currently I've learnt around 200.
 - [Theory Toolkit](https://www.diderot.one/courses/28/) by Ryan O'Donnell.
