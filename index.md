I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/)
at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). I recently finished my
Bachelor's from [Shiv Nadar University, Noida](https://snu.edu.in/), and was fortunate enough to be
advised by [Prof. Sandeep Sen](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~ssen/) for my undergraduate project.

My interests lie in the general area of Theoretical Computer Science. Currently I enjoy thinking
about problems in graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization, but I look forward to exploring
more of TCS before further specialation.

Outside of TCS, I greatly enjoy speedcubing, playing the tabla, and playing tennis. I also enjoy
ricing my operating system; and nuking `/home` partitions seems to give me immense pleasure. You can find out
more at my [official WCA page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018SUBR03) and my
[dotfiles repo](https://github.com/adisubru/dotfiles).
