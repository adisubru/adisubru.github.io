I am a PhD student in the
[Department of Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/)
at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/), where I am fortunate
to be advised by [Prof. Arindam Khan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/).
Prior to this I did my Bachelor's from [Shiv Nadar University, Noida](https://snu.edu.in/), and am
grateful for the guidance of [Prof. Sandeep Sen](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~ssen/)
for my undergraduate project.

My interests lie in the general area of Theoretical Computer Science and I am currently working on
finding approximation algorithms for geometric optimization problems. I enjoy thinking
about problems in graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization, and look forward to exploring
more of TCS.

Outside of TCS, I spend a lot of time speedcubing, and am also taking training in the Indian
percussion instrument - Tabla, under the tutelage of [Sri. Amit Mishra]
(https://www.amitmishratabla.com) of the Banaras Gharana. Lastly, since you didn't ask,
[I use arch btw](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_is_the_best). You can find out more at
my [official WCA page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018SUBR03) and my
[dotfiles repo](https://github.com/adisubru/dotfiles).
